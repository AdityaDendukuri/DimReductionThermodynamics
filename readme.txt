NEURAL NETWORK:							 
I implemented this in tensorflow. All of the code is written 
in "md_neural_net.py". 
------------------------------------------------------------------
DIFFUSION MAPS:
There are two code files: "diffmaps.py" and "diffmaps_backend.py" 
just need to run "diffmaps.py". No ML library was used for this. 
Only used numpy for linear algebra.

REPORT:
Since there is a 4 page limit for the report I omitted some diagrams which are in the slides.
