Using machine learning to reduce dimensionality of Molecular Dynamics
Systems 

------------------------------------------------------------------
NEURAL NETWORK:							 
I implemented this in tensorflow. All of the code is written 
in "md_neural_net.py". 
------------------------------------------------------------------
DIFFUSION MAPS:
There are two code files: "diffmaps.py" and "diffmaps_backend.py" 
just need to run "diffmaps.py". No ML library was used for this. 
Only used numpy for linear algebra.  
------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Set was generated by a Monte Carlo Simulatoion of Lennard Jones (N = 3) Particles.
